# cassette-planner
A (future) simple program that allows you to queue your songs for recording on your compact cassette without it ending in the middle of a song or having too large blanks at the end.

Planned features:
Accept links from youtube, soundcloud and spotify    
Maybe download the songs using youtube-dl and put them into an offline playlist to minimise ads and loading time  
Upon converting all the song lengths into seconds, will calculate the optimal order of songs on each side to maximise the length of the tape  
Auditory reminder on your pc speakers to ask you to flip the tape   
Option to have a minimum amount of slience between songs so as to allow AMS to be used    
Built-in limiter to prevent you from messing with the Dobhy NR     
Random ass button to play a 1000Hz tone to allow you to tune the speeds of your other players   
During recording (for 3 Head decks) or after recording (2 Heads) allow the microphone port of the PC to analyise the tape for left-right inbalance/dropouts/other undesirable stuff   

No idea how im going to do this or why but ill do it after my O levels end.
